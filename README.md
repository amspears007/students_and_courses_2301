## Iteration 1

Use TDD to create a `Student` class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/student'
# => true

pry(main)> student = Student.new({name: "Morgan", age: 21})    
# => #<Student:0x00007fe196b0c050...>

pry(main)> student.name
# => "Morgan"

pry(main)> student.age
# => 21

pry(main)> student.scores
# => []

pry(main)> student.log_score(89)

pry(main)> student.log_score(78)    

pry(main)> student.scores
# => [89, 78]

pry(main)> student.grade #Average of all the scores
# => 83.5
```

## Iteration 2

Use TDD to create a `Course` class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/course'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/student'
# => true

pry(main)> course = Course.new("Calculus", 2)    
# => #<Course:0x00007fa0a69be328...>

pry(main)> course.name
# => "Calculus"

pry(main)> course.capacity
# => 2

pry(main)> course.students
# => []

pry(main)> course.full?
# => false

pry(main)> student1 = Student.new({name: "Morgan", age: 21})
# => #<Student:0x00007fa0a80ae588...>

pry(main)> student2 = Student.new({name: "Jordan", age: 29})    
# => #<Student:0x00007fa0a814f4d8...>

pry(main)> course.enroll(student1)    

pry(main)> course.enroll(student2)    

pry(main)> course.students
# => [#<Student:0x00007fa0a80ae588...>, #<Student:0x00007fa0a814f4d8...>]

pry(main)> course.full?
# => true
```
## Iteration 3

You have been contracted by the University of Denver to write a program that models gradebooks for its courses. Use TDD to implement the following features:

1. Create a `Gradebook` class. Each gradebook has an `instructor`, as well as a way to read that data.
2. Each gradebook has `courses`, as well as a way to read that data.
3. A gradebook can `list_all_students` in its courses.
4. A gradebook can `students_below` to return a list of students whose grades are below a given threshold.

Method Name (query or command) | Return Value (type)
-----------                 | -------------------
`instructor` query          | `String`
`courses`    query          | `Array` of `Course` objects
`add_course(course)`command | `courses` (`Array` of `Course` objects)
`list_all_students` query   | `Hash` where the `key` is a `Course` object and the `value` is an `Array` of `Student` objects
`students_below(threshold)` | `Array` of `Student` objects


## Iteration 4

The University of Denver would like you to implement additional functionality. They would like to be able to track all the grades across all courses. They would also like to be able to find all students across all courses that have a grade in a given range.
